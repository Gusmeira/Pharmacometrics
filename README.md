# 📚 Pharmacometrics Studies Repository  

Welcome to the **Pharmacometrics Studies Repository**! This repository is a dedicated resource for pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies, including solutions to exercises from key textbooks and various related projects.  

## 🏆 Purpose  
The primary goal of this repository is to provide:  
- **Solutions to textbook exercises**: A reference for solving PK/PD problems.  
- **Project work**: Applications of pharmacometric concepts in real-world scenarios.  
- **Learning support**: A place to consolidate and expand pharmacometric knowledge.  

## 📖 Topics Covered  
- Pharmacokinetics (PK) modeling  
- Pharmacodynamics (PD) modeling  
- PK/PD parameter estimation  
- Simulation and model validation  
- Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pharmacometrics.git
   cd Pharmacometrics
   ```
2. Install any necessary dependencies (e.g., R, Python libraries, NONMEM).  
3. Explore the `books` and `projects`.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Software  
- **R**: For statistical modeling and data visualization.  
- **Python**: For scripting and pharmacometric analyses.  
- **NONMEM**: For nonlinear mixed-effects modeling.  
- **Other tools**: Add any additional software you use.  

## 🤝 Contributions  
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to add solutions, projects, or improve documentation:  
1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a new branch (`feature/my-contribution`).  
3. Commit your changes.  
4. Open a pull request.
